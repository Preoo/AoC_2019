# About
This is repo of my files for [2019's advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/)  questions.
Each days puzzle will be used as filename using convention:

'day'.py,  
'day'_tests.py

where 'day' expands to form `day_x`, for given day `x` in advent calendar.

Relevant inputs should be saved in /input/ in similar fashion.
